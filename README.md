# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis
Overview

This repository contains multiple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects performed on different datasets. The goal of these projects is to understand the data, clean it, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights using statistical analysis and visualizations.

The repository includes EDA on the following datasets:

Red Wine Quality Dataset

Flight Price Dataset

Google Play Store Dataset (Data Cleaning + EDA)

📂 Datasets and Work Description
1️⃣ Red Wine Quality Dataset

Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship between physicochemical properties and wine quality.

Analyzed features such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, and sulphates.

Used visualizations to study correlations and feature distributions.

Identified key factors affecting wine quality.

2️⃣ Flight Price Dataset

Conducted EDA to analyze factors influencing flight ticket prices.

Explored variables like airline, source, destination, duration, total stops, and journey date.

Handled missing values and performed feature analysis.

Visualized trends and patterns affecting flight prices.

3️⃣ Google Play Store Dataset
🔹 Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

Corrected data types (installs, price, reviews, etc.).

Cleaned inconsistent and incorrect entries.

Prepared the dataset for analysis.

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzed app categories, ratings, reviews, installs, and pricing.

Studied the relationship between ratings and installs.

Visualized category-wise app distribution and user engagement.

Derived insights about popular app categories and user preferences.
